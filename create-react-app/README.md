# Create React App
- To create a new React app: `yarn create react-app app-name`
- `cd app-name`
- Start server with `yarn start`

- public: (we won't need to modify almost ever)
  - index.html: this is where all of the react app funnels down to
  - div id=root is what calls src/index.js

- src: 
  - App.css has all of our styles
  - App.js is the nerve center where all components to be rendered will be called

Goal for today:
- Building a React app
- What is a component?
- How to render components in a React app
