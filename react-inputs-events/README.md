# React Inputs and Events

- DOM (Document Object Model): Tree of nodes - visual representation of our code on a page
- Virtual DOM: A representation of the actual DOM that only changes the nodes that are being interacted with - create a diff every time there is a change

## Events
- Event handlers: special methods that track events
- onChange: an attribute that lives on the input tag that captures text in an input field
  - Event is a property of the onChange listener
  - Event is an object with many key value pairs
