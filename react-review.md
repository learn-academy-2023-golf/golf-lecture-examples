# React Review

## React Intro
- React: JavaScript Library to build UI
- DOM: Document Object Model - everything you see on the screen, visual representation of the code.
- component: Building blocks for a React application, reuasble
- functional components: a reusable component written as a function
- JSX: JavaScript XML - allows us to integrate JavaScript into HTML
- React fragments: <></> a container so we can return one item of HTML in our function.  Fragment will not create an extra DOM node like a div would.
- component invocation (component call): Self closing tag with the name of the component that will allow your component to render <Greeter />

## Create React App
- node modules: dependencies needed for React or library/framework you are utilizing
- yarn: package manager for our dependencies
- kebob-case: casing convention that seperates the words with dashes
- local server: live site we can see on our local machine
- localhost:3000: address we use in our browser to see our local server in a React app
- PascalCase: naming convention where every word is capitilized.  Used for classes, and the components in React
- export: allowing component to be accessed from within the React application

## React State
- state: a special variable in React that belongs to a React component that will cause page rerenders if the state variable is updated
- useState: a hook provided by React, useState allows us to utilize state variables
- React hooks: a React built in method
- separation of concerns: each component is in charge of it's own functionality
- container component: a component that is calling on additional components (oftentimes App.js)
- presentational component: a component who's job is to display content
- block level element: element or div takes the entire width of the page
